# 🍽️ FoodShare — SDG 2: Zero Hunger

FoodShare is a community-driven platform designed to reduce food waste and hunger by connecting restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals with surplus food to charities or people in need.

> **Goal:** Support the United Nations **Sustainable Development Goal 2 — Zero Hunger**  
> **Mission:** “No good food should go to waste when someone needs it.”

---

## 🌍 Overview

FoodShare allows users to:
- Post **available food donations**
- Browse **nearby available food**
- Connect donors with charities or individuals
- Track impact (e.g., meals shared, locations served)

In the MVP, we’re using a mock JSON backend (`json-server`), but the structure is designed to easily evolve into a full-stack app with user authentication and real-time features.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Frontend | React (CRA) | UI & routing |
| Backend (mock) | JSON Server | Simulated REST API |
| Styling | CSS (custom, green theme) | Simple, SDG 2-aligned design |
| Authentication (upcoming) | Firebase Auth / JWT | For sign-in & user profiles |
| Hosting (optional) | Vercel / Netlify | Frontend deployment |
| Database (future) | Firebase / MongoDB | Replace mock API |

## 👥 Team Workflow (Git & Collaboration)

### Branching Strategy

We use a **feature-branch workflow** to avoid conflicts.

| Branch           | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `main`           | Stable, deploy-ready version                 |
| `dev`            | Staging branch for testing                   |
| `feature/<name>` | Work on new features (e.g., `feature/login`) |

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/login

# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add login page"

# Push your branch
git push origin feature/login
```

Then go to GitHub → open a **Pull Request** into `dev`.

## 🔨 Task Breakdown (for 4 Developers)

| Area                  | Developer  | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Lead**     | Team lead  | Set up pages, routing, API integration              |
| **Backend / API**     | Teammate 1 | Manage JSON Server, seed data, mock endpoints       |
| **Auth & Users**      | Teammate 2 | Implement login/signup (Firebase or JWT mock)       |
| **UI / UX & Styling** | Musa       | Beautify components, add responsiveness, animations |

## 💅 Design & Beautification Plan

We’ll gradually polish the UI:

1. **Color Palette:**
   Green (#4caf50), white, light grey — consistent with SDG 2.

2. **Typography:**
   Use *Inter* or *Poppins* fonts for clean, modern UI.

3. **Components to Refine:**

   * Navbar (navigation between pages)
   * Cards for food listings
   * Buttons and form styling
   * Responsive mobile layout

4. **Optional Libraries:**

   * `react-icons` (for icons)
   * `framer-motion` (simple animations)
   * `react-router-dom` (for navigation)

---

## 🔑 Authentication (Planned Upgrade)

We’ll use **Firebase Authentication** for email/password sign-ins:

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable Email/Password sign-in.
3. Add Firebase config to `client/src/firebase.js`.
4. Add:

   * `/login` page
   * `/signup` page
   * Context for user session
5. Protect routes (e.g., Dashboard → only for logged-in users).

---

## 🧪 Testing

Simple local testing via:

* `npm start` (React)
* `json-server` mock API
* Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or browser to verify backend routes.

---

## 🧰 Useful Scripts

Frontend:

```bash
npm start       # Start dev server
npm run build   # Build for production
```

Backend:

```bash
json-server --watch server/db.json --port 8001
```

---

## 📈 Deployment (optional)

* **Frontend:** Deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* **Backend:** For mock stage, use [Render](https://render.com/) or migrate to Firebase Realtime DB later.

---

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

1. Always create a new branch from `dev`
2. Write clear commit messages:

   ```
   feat: add login page
   fix: resolve form validation bug
   style: update dashboard layout
   ```
3. Avoid pushing directly to `main`
4. Before merging → ensure everything runs without errors

## 🧠 Troubleshooting

| Issue                 | Cause                    | Fix                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| JSON Server not found | Not installed globally   | `npm install -g json-server`   |
| CORS error            | Fetching from wrong port | Use `http://localhost:8001`    |
| "Module not found"    | Missing import           | Check file paths               |
| App won’t start       | Wrong directory          | Run `npm start` from `/client` |
